deadman-gui
===========

Minimal GUI scaffold for the `deadman` project using `eframe` (egui).

Run locally:

```bash
cargo run -p deadman-gui
```

Notes:
- Uses `eframe = "0.24"` which requires a recent Rust toolchain.
- If building on Linux, ensure relevant system libraries for GUI are available.
